Subject: Apology for Missed Worksheet Submission and Submission Update

Mr. Lothian,

I apologize for not realizing that the Arakis Worksheet assignment was meant for in-class submission. I understand the mistake and take full responsibility. I wanted to inform you that I will have the assignment ready and will hand it to you tomorrow morning.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Abdullah
